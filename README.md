# Gamer Skill Demo

This is a demonstration of a custom skill system for a hypothetical video game.
For a list of implemented features, take a look at the [Project Features](https://github.com/wille179/gamer_skill_demo/wiki/Project-Features) page, and for a list of features in progress, look at the [Project TODOs](https://github.com/wille179/gamer_skill_demo/wiki/Project-TODOs) page.

This project is under the Unliscence. Have fun playing with it if you want.
